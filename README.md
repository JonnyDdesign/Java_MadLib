# **Custom MadLib Using Java**

## Description
This was a frun project creating and using variables in Java to create a MadLib story. I wanted to test out using Java to create a simple story and inject variables and printing them out. The challenge was to make sure all variables were accounted for in the story and the correct syntax was used in order to print the story correctly and accurately.

## Install and Run
Open up your terminal and compile the code before running it. You will see the silly madlib story printed out to your terminal. Enjoy a fun story!
